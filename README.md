First JavaScript SPA-project. 
This project is a frontend that communicates with a backend API provided by the school (Which I am not uploading here since I did not build it myself.). I was responsible only for the frontend development.

As a first frontend projekt there is still many improvements to be done. For example better structure, less code repetition with reusable components, better funtionality and safety for handling login, passwords and usernames 
and improvements for responsitivity for smaller screen sizes.
